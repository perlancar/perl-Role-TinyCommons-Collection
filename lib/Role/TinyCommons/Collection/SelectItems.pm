# ABSTRACT: The search_items() interface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your class:

 package YourClass;
 use Role::Tiny::With;
 with 'Role::TinyCommons::Collection::SelectItems';

 sub new { ... }
 sub select_items { ... }
 ...
 1;

In the code of your class user:

 use YourClass;

 my $obj = YourClass->new(...);

 # basic select
 my @results = $obj->select_items("age.min" => 20);
 die "There are no items matching that criteria" unless @results;

 # ordering

 # paging

 ## only return the first 5 results
 my @results = $obj->select_items("age.min" => 20, result_limit => 5);

 ## return the next 5 results (one-based indexing)
 my @results = $obj->select_items("age.min" => 20, result_limit => 5, result_start => 6);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<search_items()> is an interface to search (select) items in a collection based
on some criteria. Some options are provided. The implementor is given
flexibility to support additional options, but the basic modes of selecting must
be supported.

To do exact matching and return a single result, there is the
L<Role::TinyCommons::Collection::FindItem> interface.


=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=head2 select_items

Usage:

 my @results = $obj->select_items(%args);

Search collection based on some criteria. Must return 0 or more results as list.
Need not return the items themselves, but can (and should preferrably) return
only the item ID's or some other unique attribute of the items, unless the
L</detail> mode is enabled, in which must return the items themselves. All
matching items must be returned unless L</result_limit> and L</result_start>
options are specified, in which case only a subset of results is returned.

Arguments:

To specify per-attribute criteria, the C<ATTR.OPERATOR> is recommended. For
example C<age.min> specifies minimum age, while C<name.is> specifies name to
match exactly.

=over

=item * detail

Type: bool.

This argument should be supported for collections that have structured items.

=item * result_limit

Type: uint. If specified, only at most this number of results should be
returned. result_limit and result_start work like LIMIT clause in SQL SELECT
statement.

This argument is optional to implement; if unimplemented should still return
results intead of returning an error.

=item * result_start

Type: posint (positive integer). If specified, return from the n'th result.
Default if unspecified is 1, meaning to return from the first result.
result_limit and result_start work like LIMIT clause in SQL SELECT statement.

This argument is optional to implement.

=item * ignore_case

Type: bool. If set to true, must enable case-insensitive matching. Otherwise,
matching should be case-sensitive.

This argument is optional to implement. It should be supported if stringwise
comparison is used.

=back

Implementor is free to add more options.


=head1 PROVIDED METHODS

=head2 has_matching_item

Usage:

 my $has_matching_item = $obj->has_matching_item(%args);

Equivalent to:

 my @results = $obj->select_items(result_limit => 1, %args);
 return @results ? 1:0;

Name is chosen to not conflict with
L<Role::TinyCommons::Collection::FindItem/has_item> from
L<Role::TinyCommons::Collection::FindItem>.

=head2 select_first

Usage:

 my $item = $obj->select_first(%args);

Return C<undef> (if not found) or the result (if found). Can be ambiguous if
item can be C<undef>. Equivalent to:

 my @results = $obj->select_items(result_limit => 1, %args);
 return @results ? $results[0] : undef;
